# PluginArchitecture

A basic Implementation for a plugin architecture.<br>
<br>
My concept for a modular Framework that works with different plugins.<br>
The base moduke can handle Input and return Values from the plugins<br>
It can catch wrong or unsuitable files.<br>
The whole idea is that all main funtions are handled as modules, future extensions will be loaded much like the main modules.<br>
